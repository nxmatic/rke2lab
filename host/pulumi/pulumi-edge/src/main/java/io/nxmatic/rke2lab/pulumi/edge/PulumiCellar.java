/**
 * The Pulumi realisation of the {@link Cellar} conservation role — the commissioner's neutral store
 * over the Pulumi file backend, fusing the three former doctor-named host journals ({@code
 * MedicalRecordJournal}, {@code InterventionJournal}, {@code InterventionLedgerWriter}) into one.
 * It holds nothing but sealed {@link SeedEnvelope}s addressed by a {@link Parcel}; it never names a
 * doctor type and never opens a payload.
 *
 * <p><b>The durable coquille.</b> Every entry is persisted as a self-characterising CLEAR shell of
 * five flat fields around the opaque payload — {@code {domain, trail, tombstone, mac, payload}} —
 * registered as the entry's Pulumi output (keyed by the coordinate slug, the shelf label). The
 * {@code domain} and the {@code trail} (the value's fil d'Ariane, § fil-d-ariane) thus SURVIVE the
 * durable round-trip; the {@code payload} rides as a STRING field, so a SEALED {@code
 * cellar:sealed:v1:…} value is just a field value, no longer a Map the store must parse (the
 * blocker that made durable sealing impossible). The {@code mac} is an HMAC over the clear
 * characterisation, keyed by the cellar's own passphrase — a property of the CELLAR, not the seal
 * (decision A): every coquille carries one, so a fetch can trust ANY value's lineage and any tamper
 * of the clear shell OR the sealed payload fails closed. The host never opens the payload — it MACs
 * and carries the opaque bytes — so the {@link OpaqueCellar} contract ("never opens a payload")
 * holds literally.
 *
 * <p><b>Two soils, one verb.</b> The cellar detects whether a {@link Parcel} is the RUN's OWN
 * stack, but by a DIFFERENT signal for a write than for a read. A WRITE asks the live Pulumi
 * deployment installed on THIS thread (§ {@link PulumiDeploymentSeed#targets}) — staging into the
 * one deployment needs it here. A READ asks the run stack's IDENTITY (§ {@link
 * PulumiDeploymentSeed#runStack}, captured host-side at construction), thread-INDEPENDENT — so a
 * scion reading off the deployment thread still reads the run stack's current state, not the
 * side-stack history-walk. That discriminant routes {@code store} / {@code fetch} / {@code
 * withdraw} down one of two paths; the scion never picks — each verb stays neutral.
 *
 * <p><b>store</b> — the RUN's own stack STAGES the coquille and {@link #conserve} re-declares the
 * whole live set as {@code CellarEntry} resources INTO the run's single deployment: the harvest
 * folds into the ONE history alongside the infra (incus, cluster), with no nested {@code up} and no
 * lock contention (the fatal collision of the old separate-{@code up} design). A SIDE stack (the
 * doctor's ledger, its own project) has no live deployment, so it files EAGERLY: an out-of-run
 * {@code up()} routed by the injected {@link RunGate} CONSERVES it (a stable resource name per
 * coordinate makes each append a history entry); a {@code preview()} PRE-RESERVES it, touching no
 * state.
 *
 * <p><b>fetch</b> — rebuilds one {@link SeedEnvelope} per stored coquille, VERIFYING its MAC and
 * restoring {@code domain} + {@code trail} + opaque {@code payload}, keyed by the output's NATIVE
 * name (the coordinate). The read is FILTERED to the {@code rke2lab:cellar:Entry} type, so the
 * resources the run's own stack co-hosts (the incus provider, the root Stack) are ignored rather
 * than mistaken for malformed coquilles. The run's stack (told by IDENTITY, so any thread reads it
 * alike) reads its CURRENT state (every live coquille sits in the one checkpoint); a side stack
 * walks its history append-log. The typed overloads ({@code fetch(parcel, type)}, {@code
 * fetch(parcel, coordinate, type)}) DELEGATE the decode to the {@link SeedCodec} — the host decodes
 * any type ITS classpath holds; a type it lacks (a bundle type) is the codec's throw, not a cellar
 * rule.
 *
 * <p><b>withdraw</b> — the RUN's own stack STAGES a removal: the coordinate is simply not
 * re-declared by {@code conserve}, so the run's authoritative {@code up} reaps it — no in-band
 * tombstone. A side stack files a TOMBSTONE coquille ({@code tombstone=true}, a first-class CLEAR
 * shell flag) so the current-state fold reads the case empty while history keeps the trace.
 *
 * <p><b>conserve</b> — the end-of-drain flush for the run's own stack: desired = the live coquilles
 * carried forward (re-declared so the authoritative {@code up} does not reap them) merged with this
 * run's staged changes. A no-op for the eager side-stack path (already committed per store).
 *
 * <p><b>neighbours</b> — the sibling parcels under the same backend soil (the parcel's own first).
 *
 * <p>An absent file backend yields an empty neighbourhood (just the parcel) and empty fetches; a
 * present-but-unreadable state or history propagates (corruption is not absence); a coquille whose
 * MAC does not verify is tamper, and fails closed rather than degrading to a skip.
