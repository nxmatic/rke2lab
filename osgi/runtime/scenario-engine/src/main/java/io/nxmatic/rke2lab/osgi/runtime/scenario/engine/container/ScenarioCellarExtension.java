/**
 * The transactional-cellar bracket: injects the run's {@link ScenarioCellar} before the body, and
 * at the boundary DRAINS the accumulated tags to the durable backend — for ANY {@link RunRole#ROOT}
 * run, whether it PASSED or FAILED. A {@link RunRole#FRAGMENT} is inert (its tags ride the graft up
 * to the root, which drains for all of them). The drain is NOT gated on success: the world this
 * cellar mirrors is non-transactional (a failed run leaves the stack, the instance, the host
 * filesystem where it stopped), so the harvest filed before the failure point is real and must
 * persist — else the cellar diverges from reality and the next run re-derives a fact that already
 * exists. "Transactional" here names the DRAIN mechanics — one ordered, batched flush at the
 * boundary (§ one-history) — not an all-or-nothing success gate. The only thing a failed run drops
 * is the within-run bus ({@link Persistence#TRANSIENT}), evicted by the drain itself. See
 * docs/architecture/osgi/seed-broker-spec.adoc (§ cellar-transactional).
 *
 * <p>Dual-loaded (host-flat + one copy per bundle), and the OWNER of the cellar's lifecycle: it
 * builds the {@link ScenarioCellar}, hands it the durable-read {@code Supplier}, and drains at the
 * boundary. Nothing is inferred: the {@link RunRole} is read from the launcher session store
 * (seeded by whoever launched — {@code Main} seeds ROOT, a sown scion's own session defaults to
 * FRAGMENT). The durable resolution is DUAL-REALM by the instance's realm: a host-flat root through
 * the world connection ({@link BaseWorldExtension}'s class store), an in-container scion through
 * its own bundle registry ({@code ScenarioRegistry}) — the route it used before the cellar was
 * injected.
