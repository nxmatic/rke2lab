 * Seam toward the {@code sops} external tool: seal a plaintext YAML document for a set of age
 * recipients, returning the sops-encrypted YAML. A pure point of contact — it reasons over nothing,
 * it shells a tool — so, like {@code SshToAgeConverter} in manifests-contract, it is owned by the
 * consumer that needs it (the cluster-pki seal, so the seam lives in this contract) and realised by
 * the top-level {@code sops-edge}, which {@code @Component}-provides it; the seal binds it with a
 * mandatory {@code @Reference}.
 *
 * <p>The node consumes the result via {@code sops-nix}, which requires the true sops envelope
 * format — hence a tool, not a Java re-implementation. The recipients are the operator's own age
 * identity AND the cluster age recipient (so both {@code us} and the node can decrypt); the edge
 * forces default encrypt-all ({@code --config /dev/null}) so the repo's {@code .sops.yaml}
 * comment-regex rule cannot leave values in the clear.
