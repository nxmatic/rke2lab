/**
 * The worktree snapshot the worktree soil harvests into the cellar and the flat host fetches back —
 * the {@code Worktree} service's facts flattened onto the wire: the {@code root} (as a String path;
 * the host re-hydrates a {@link java.nio.file.Path}), the HEAD {@link Provenance}, and the {@link
 * WorkingState}. The worktree {@code @Component} holds the live service OSGi-side; its soil
 * scenario packs THIS record and stores it at {@link WorktreeCoordinate#FACTS}, so no jgit type and
 * no service reference crosses the seam — only the serialized payload, which the host decodes into
 * its OWN copy of this dual-realm record.
 *
 * <p>{@link SeedContract} binds it to the {@code worktree-facts} coordinate for the codec's decode
 * guard; the wire-record type never crosses the seam, only the serialized payload.
