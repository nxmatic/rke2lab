 * and {@code incus} both resolve on {@code PATH}, otherwise by streaming that script over {@code
 * ssh} to the builder host. The host keeps the Pulumi {@code Image} resource, the artifact cache,
 * and the config-derived path translation, and composes this contact only when a rebuild is
 * actually needed.
 *
 * <p>The grain is coarse — one call runs a whole build — but it owns no caching and no policy: it
 * builds when asked and throws on failure.
