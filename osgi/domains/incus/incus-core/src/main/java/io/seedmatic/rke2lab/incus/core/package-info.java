/**
 * The incus domain's in-container LOGIC — pure Java driven by the incus scenarios: the grow-view

 * io.seedmatic.rke2lab.incus.core.GrowIdentityResolver} / {@link
 * io.seedmatic.rke2lab.incus.core.GrowPlanAssembler} the provision scion assembles the {@code
 * InstanceGrowPlan} from) and the launch-secrets writer ({@link
 * io.seedmatic.rke2lab.incus.core.LaunchSecretsWriter}). The wire-records these read/write live in
 * {@code incus-contract}; this module holds only the logic. The former host-tree slot-rotation /
 * staging→live promotion moved to git (the rendered-branch model) and was removed.
